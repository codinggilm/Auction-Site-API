# Auction Site API
 

## Description
This server supports the UI of the auction site. It handles the requests and updates the (hardcoded) database accordingly. <br />
Using Socket.IO, it allows real time UI update on the client side. <br />
As an ongoing project, I plan to improve the code and functionality.

## Improving the server
At the moment, if a user refreshes the page on the client side, the bid result message disappears and the user can keep biding. <br />
I will re-implement the option to update the bid status on the back end to fix this. 



## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* NODE.JS
* EXPRESS.JS
* Socket.IO
* NPM
