# Auction Site API
 

## Description
This server supports the UI of the auction site. It handles the requests and updates the (hardcoded) database accordingly. <br />
Using Socket.IO, it allows real time UI update on the front end. <br />
As an ongoing project, I plan to improve the code and functionality.



## Technologies Used
* NODE.JS
* Socket.IO
* NPM
* POSTMAN
